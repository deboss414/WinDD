# WinDD Project Progress Summary

## Project Setup and Initial Issues
1. Started with an Expo React Native project
2. Initial attempt to start the project using `npx expo start --clear`
3. Encountered port conflict - Port 8081 was in use, switched to port 8082
4. Watchman warnings appeared regarding cache and directory scanning

## Environment Configuration
- Project Location: `/Users/pherson/Desktop/Development/WIND-Frontend/WinDD`
- Using Expo framework
- Mock mode enabled (`useMock: true`)

## Dependencies Status
Current package management issues identified:
- Multiple package managers in use (both npm and yarn)
- Duplicate node_modules directories:
  - `node_modules/`
  - `node_modules 2/`
- Multiple lock files present:
  - `yarn.lock`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `package-lock 2.json`

## Authentication Implementation
- Mock service implementation reviewed
- Login functionality implemented with:
  - Test credentials: email: `test@example.com`
  - Mock token: 'mock-token-123'
  - Simulated network delay of 500ms
- AsyncStorage being used for token management

## Current Issues
1. Package Management Conflicts:
   - Multiple package managers causing potential dependency conflicts
   - Duplicate node_modules directories may cause module resolution issues
   - Mixed lock files creating inconsistent dependency states

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Clean up package management:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/
   rm -rf node_modules\ 2/
   rm package-lock.json
   rm package-lock\ 2.json
   rm yarn.lock
   rm -rf .expo/
   ```
2. Choose single package manager (recommended: yarn)
3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
4. Restart the application:
   ```bash
   yarn start --clear
   ```

## Mock Service Details
- Location: `WinDD/src/services/MockService.ts`
- Implements:
  - Login/Register functionality
  - User management
  - Task management
  - Project management
- Uses AsyncStorage for token persistence

## Project Structure
Key files and directories:
- `/src/services/MockService.ts` - Mock service implementation
- `/src/mocks/mockData.ts` - Mock data and test credentials
- `/src/utils/apiClient.ts` - API client with token interceptor
- `/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook

## Dependencies
